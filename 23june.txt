1) STLC Phases

There are 6 major phases of STLC -

Requirement Analysis - When the SRD is ready and shared with the stakeholders, the testing team starts high level analysis concerning the AUT (Application under Test).

Test Planning - Test Team plans the strategy and approach.

Test Case Designing - Develop the test cases based on scope and criteria’s.

Test Environment Setup - When integrated environment is ready to validate the product.

Test Execution - Real-time validation of product and finding bugs.

Test Closure - Once testing is completed, matrix, reports, results are documented.


2)Test case - Test scenario- Use case - Introduction and differences

3)Error, defect, bug, failure
“A mistake in coding is called Error, error found by tester is called Defect, 
defect accepted by development team then it is called Bug, build does not meet the requirements then it Is Failure.”


4)Test Case Design Technique
-Boundary Value Analysis
-Equivalence Partitioning
- Decision table
